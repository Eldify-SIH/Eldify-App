    <string name="cobblers_pose">
           Step1:  It is important to have the pelvis in a neutral position, so sitting on stacked blankets etc\n
                   might be necessary to make that happen. When the pelvis is able to tilt forward,\n
                   you can come into the forward bend variation like in the picture. Otherwise,\n
                   hold on to your feet and keep sitting straight up.\n\n
           Step2: In the full pose, the knees are on the floor, but in reality that isn’t happening for a lot of people.\n
                  Accept that your knees can be anywhere from as high as your shoulders to half way down or lower! It’s all ok,\n
                  you will all still get the benefits.\n\n
           Step3: Do not force the knees down in this pose, rather release the head of the thighbones\n
                  (top of the thighbones) to the floor, and let the knees flow, following that action.\n
                  You can stay anywhere from 1-5 minutes in this pose.\n
